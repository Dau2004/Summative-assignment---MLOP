```

### 4. Data Setup
The application includes a pre-trained model, but you can add your own data:

1. Place training images in `weather_dataset/` folders:
   - `weather_dataset/Cloudy/`
   - `weather_dataset/Rain/`
   - `weather_dataset/Shine/`
   - `weather_dataset/Sunrise/`

2. Use the Upload screen in the app to add new training data

3. Retrain the model using the Retrain screen
